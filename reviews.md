## Selected reviews and recommendations
 
> "After the last performance the jury deliberated and chose 27-year-old Martin Malmgren as the winner. Malmgren (...) played Sergei Prokofiev’s fifth piano concerto as his final piece. The rarely heard concerto has five movements, and it suited its performer perfectly and accentuated his personal style.

> Out of all the finalists Malmgren had the broadest interpretative and dynamic scale, which vibrantly emphasized the musical extremes. The phrase “piano is a percussion instrument” was often accurate about the nature of the concerto, and the accuracy of intensity, length, and timing of Malmgren’s accents was astounding. He was just as at home during the quieter and more peaceful parts of the concerto."

> "With remarkable symbiosis between emotion and intelligence, and with poetic touch and virtuosity, he puts the music first."

> "Martin Malmgren sits unusually far from the grand piano, which brings certain extra objectivity to the sound control. Alban Bergs Sonata was far from the paleness that is easily affiliated with fin de siecle, and he managed to insert impressive sparks into his Lindberg pieces. (...) Ravels Gaspard de la nuit took the listener to a whole different wave lenghts. (...) Colourful sound, fine dynamics and indescribably intensive rythm swept one away."
